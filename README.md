###ABOUT

The Hypothetical Operating System Term Project simulates how an operation system would sort tasks in memory and allocate processor time.
Our project parameters were to randomly create twenty jobs and run them over thirty time units on a simulated quad-core processor.
There were three test cases involving different sorting and memory allocation methods.

Case One:        First-Come First-Served, First-Fit, Round Robin

Case Two:        First-Come First-Served, Best-Fit, Round Robin

Case Three:      Shortest-Job First-Served, Best-Fit, Round Robin

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS

Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the src directory in the terminal. 
Type "javac MainOS.java". Once all files are compiled, type "java MainOS" into the terminal
to generate results.

        
The output files will be saved to the working directory that the program was run.
